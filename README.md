Proposed System:
The primary objective of unit convertor application is to allow its users to make most used unit conversions like kilogram to pound, pound to gram, kilometre to meter, meter to centimetre and many more including other basic length and weight conversions. The project’s scope is to provide easy and hassle-free unit conversions.
 
Functionality & concepts used:
•	The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps in easy and hassle-free unit conversion. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app:
•	ScrollView: A view group that is used to make vertically scrollable views. A scroll view contains a single direct child only. In order to place multiple views in the scroll view, one needs to make a view group (like LinearLayout) as a direct child and then we can define many views inside it. A ScrollView supports Vertical scrolling only, so to create a horizontally scrollable view, HorizontalScrollView is used.
•	Linear Layout: Linear layout is a simple layout used in android for layout designing. In the Linear layout all the elements are displayed in linear fashion means all the childs/elements of a linear layout are displayed according to its orientation. 
•	Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for users to convert usnits without providing detailed instructions. App also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.

Application link & Future Scope:
•	You can access the app 
•	We aim to add certain more unit conversions like temperature , currency ( with day to day changes) , etc.
